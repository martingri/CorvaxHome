"Clean Code is a term coined by Robert C. Martin and is the practice of "
"writing elegant and structured code in an organized manner in order to make "

"Many companies attempt to improve collaboration in their development teams "
"by establishing a coding convention that everyone should follow. In my "
"experience, however, most, if not all, fail to accomplish this because of "
"the personal preferences of the members. It is important to thoroughly "
"motivate the best practices and strive to agree about the set of rules. "
"Someone outside the team is often better suited for running these processes "
"to avoid internal conflicts in the team. My Clean Code workshops encourages "
"teamwork and opens up for dialogue around the concepts of Clean Code. By "
"combining the workshop with a set of tasks the developers are challenged to "
"test and explore the concepts from the workshop, giving them a deeper "
"understanding and practical experience."
